      <p>Did you know... The Panama Canal Watershed is more than just an interoceanic route for global trade; it also supplies more than 50% of the population and is an important source of energy for the country, responsible for 67.2% of the electricity generated in Panama?</p>

      <p>In recent years, due to global warming and climate change, we have had less rainfall, and therefore less water in the lakes and less hydroelectric generation. This will lead to a 25% loss of all hydroelectric generation by 2040 and impact maritime traffic.</p>

      <p>For our STEM Week, we propose implementing a water Recycling Tank System in The Panama Canal Watershed, with a special focus on the function of Gatun Lake. Achieving greater efficiency in reuse will allow water to be filtered and cleaned more efficiently. Adaptability to different levels of drought will allow the system to operate efficiently even during periods of extreme drought, and reduction of freshwater consumption will help preserve this vital resource as much as possible.</p>
